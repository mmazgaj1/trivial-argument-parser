Types of arguments:
  a) flag,
  b) value,
  c) value list,
  d) default value.

a) Flag appears without any value given after it. It is supposed to signalize true value if it appears and false value if it doesn't appear.
b) Value needs to have a string value associated to itself. Can appear only once.
c) Value list is created by allowing value to appear more than once. String values are stored in a vector.
d) Default value is a value that appears only once and doesn't need a flag to be used before it.

Arguments may have long or short versions e.g. long version - "--argument-name", short version - "-a".
If in any type of value, a string value is not given then an error should be returned.
First string value, which is not preceded with an argument name, is considered default value. Any other appearance of dangling string value should return error.
